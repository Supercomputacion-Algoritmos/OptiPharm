## [OptiPharm20210112] - 20210112
- Fixed a problem in the OP_MRMS script that rotated a molecule when the angle was not valid. It now returns an error message and does not modify the molecule.
- Fixed a bug that existed in the limits that were multiplied by 500. This came from tests that had been done previously.
